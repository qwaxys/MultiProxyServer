~~MultiProxyServer~~
=============

Just use a [DNS SRV record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record#cite_note-7) instead.

~~A proxy that not only let you run multiple virtual Minecraft servers but can also handle different protocols all of which on one port.~~
~~Current supported protocols:~~
 * ~~Minecraft~~
 * ~~IRC (unencrypted)~~
 * ~~HTTP~~
 * ~~HTTPS~~*
 
~~*note: without client authentication works, I haven't tested the other ones.~~

~~You will also need to add the correct certificates.~~

~~Why?~~
-------
 * ~~Some internet providers block certain ports.~~
 * ~~Corporations/organisations have a firewall, running everything on 80 or 443 might fix this.~~
 * ...

~~Usage~~
-------
~~there are ony 2 commands:~~
 * ~~reload - this will reload the configuration file.~~
 * ~~quit - exit the program.~~
 
~~When you run the program for the first time a config wil be generated in the same directory.~~
~~You can also start with the config as a parameter. Example:~~

	MultiProxy.exe C:\someDir\aConfigFile.xml

~~Configuration~~
-------
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
	<multiproxyserver>
	  <port>1212</port>
	  <endpoint>0.0.0.0</endpoint>
	  <motd>A Minecraft Proxy</motd>
	  <pingremote>true</pingremote>
	  <usersinmotd>true</usersinmotd>
	  <vhosts>
		<vhost host="example.com" destination="localhost:25565" />
		<vhost host="test.example.com" destination="localhost:25569" />
		<vhost host="alpha.example.com" destination="localhost" />
		<default destination="localhost:25565"></default>
	  </vhosts>
	  <webserver>qwaxys-mini:80</webserver>
	  <ircserver>irc.kreynet.org:6667</ircserver>
	</multiproxyserver>
	
~~port: The proxyserver wil be listening on this port. Defaults to 25565~~

~~motd: The message of the day is the same for each server. Defaults to "A Minecraft Proxy".~~

~~pingremote: If enabled the playercount and max player will be the sum of vhosts. Defaults to false.~~

~~usersinmotd: If enabled the motd will be appended with a list of all servers and the amount of players, example: "A Minecraft Proxy Servername (3/20) ServernameTwo (1/20)".~~

~~vhosts: A list of virtual servers.~~

~~vhost: A virtual server, host is the address that a client connects to, destination is where the server actualy runs. The port number is optional.~~

~~webserver: The webserver to where all requests are forwarded. You don't need to add virtual hosts here, the webserver should handle that.~~

~~Defaults to "localhost", the port defaults to 80.~~

~~When a browsers connects using HTTPS then the proxy will allways use 443.~~

~~ircserver: The IRC server. Defaults to "localhost", the port defaults to 6667.~~
